# Circuit CAD

This repository contains all the schematics and layouts for Cal Poly Space System's hardware.
Starting in 2015, CPSS's avionics team has been iterating and improving its flight computer technology. We have several series of flight computers in development.

# UpBoard
In 2015, CPSS began developing a flight computer for the rocket known as UpGoer. The name was changed but the derived "UpBoard" moniker stuck, and since then we have been iterating the design to be ever more complex, culminating with the UpBoardX based on the Arduino Due. 

# Rek Series
In 2017, CPSS started developing its own line of cheap and standardized flight recorders under the Rek name. These Arduino-Based boards have various capabilities to record and transmit data in flight.

# Peripherals
This folder contains all our circuit boards designed to act as peripherals to our main flight computers. These include communications, data collection, and more.
